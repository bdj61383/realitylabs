%h1 Hello World!!!
%p 
  This is just some rando text I'm throwing up to illustrate that everything's working as it should.  Holla!  This page should appear in /leagues as the index page.

%table#leagues
  %thead
    %tr
      %th League ID
      %th League Name
      %th Confirmation Code
  %tbody
    - @leagues.each do |league|
      %tr
        %td= league.id
        %td= league.name 
        %td= league.confirmation_code
